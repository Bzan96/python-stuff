# These are all minigames of some sort I created, either completely on my own or by following user stories

### When doing these projects I learned more and more about Python, but also what it is like to use code to create things on my own.

None of these use any sort of advanced code really and are in essence a beginners first attempts at becoming a professional coder.

Some of these projects still contain bugs and others aren't even complete.

**One that stands out for me personally is the Blackjack game.**
I sat down one full Saturday and spent about 12 hours with an idea in mind. The code itself, when I look at it now, is quite terrible and trying the game now reveals quite a few funny bugs, but when it comes down to it, this is the first project I came up with myself and also completed completely on my own. This is where I decided I wanted to become a programmer for real.
That is also why I havn't gone back and fixed the bugs, because it serves a sentimental purpose for me.

**Another one that might deserve a deeper explanation is the hangman one**
This was a project I created while delving deeper into what Python was at work a few years ago. I found this Youtube-channel called CodeGirls or something similar where they created a simple Hangman-game as a tutorial. I followed said tutorial, but soon discovered that the game was riddled with bugs, so I sat down to fix those bugs and I soon realized I could turn that simple game into a bookable program for schools, which I later did.
