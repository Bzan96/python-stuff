## Starry Sky
This is a project I created while exploring the turtle library in Python. It isn't any sort of advanced code, but rather an attempt at using Python to create a sort of artful animation.

## 100 Innovations projects
These are actually projects I created while working at my museum job. I had a task in where I was supposed to create a new, rather large concept at the museum and doing so became quite complicated. As I did it during the summer I didn't have a lot of people to try out the concepts on, so I turned to code to do so. I created the live experience I had in mind in code and by doing so I could both correct some minor issues with it, but also see that what I had in mind would actually work.
And while my boss insisted on trying it on pupils as well, those tests - while I was there to lead them - worked as could be expected.
It also proved to be a classic example of using code to lessen the workload while working with people who don't understand code and thus not gaining much traction.
